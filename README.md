Let's Play Blackjack!

Hello, 

for our final project, we have created an enhanced blackjack game on glitch! Starting from a barebones, but functional blackjack code, we added features that improve the player experience and functionality of the game.

Our features include:
1. A functional betting system where you can decide what increments you wish to bet with from your starting bank of $1000
2. A bank value tracker to help you keep an eye on your profits or losses
3. A scoreboard to keep track of your Wins, Draws, and Losses
4. A basic blackjack strategy recommendation for those new to the game
5. A celebratory $Cha-Ching$ for when you cash in a victory
6. An endgame message when you run out of money prompting you to restart

We faced my challanges along the way, many stemming from the original cluttered code and misleading variable names. But, we're very happy with the final product and hope you enjoy playing!
